# Jetson_I2C
This is a repository for test files intended for enabling I2C communication between the Jetson TX2 developer kit mounted on the REM-U robot and various subsystems. It is currently being integrated with ROS melodic and python. This will allow communication with integrated circuits in the Arm and Power subsystems and enable control of their respective embedded devices.
